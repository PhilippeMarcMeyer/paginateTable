# paginateTable
a short vanilla js function to paginate an existing TABLE
Old script from 2010 tant could be useful and updated

Nowdays we use lots of plugins to build beautiful TABLE
and even without we tend to rather create a TABLE with data and rewrite it to the DOM whenever we change page or make a search

This is not about that :
Il you have a static Table existing in the DOM use this function to paginate
